# JavaScript-Challenge

This homework entailed using JavaScript and DOM (Document Object Model) manipulations to define logical structure of documents and a way to accessed and manipulate documents. Even though DOM is designed to be used with any programming language, JavaScript was used.
There are 15 JavaScript Methods for DOM Manipulation for Web developers, of the 15 methods I used EventListener:
•	querySelector(), querySelectorAll(), addEventListener(), removeEventListener(), createElement(), appendChild, removeChild(), replaceChild(), cloneNode(), insertBefore(),
•	createDocumentFragment(),  getComputedStyle(), setAttribute(), getAttribute(), removeAttribute().
A starter code was provided. However, I created my own code to complete the homework assignment. Using JavaScript my code was written to dynamically access a table of data extracted from a UFO Sighting database. The results were displayed as a HTML document that used EventListener to listen for events (data requests). The EventListener was activated every time a search on the date/time column was made to find rows that matched the user’s input.
Lastly, multiple input tags using JavaScript code were created to filter and search for UFO sightings data based five of the seven table columns.

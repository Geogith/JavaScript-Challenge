# UFO Sightings

JavaScript and DOM (Document Object Model) was used for defining a logical way to structure, access, and manipulate a table content. Even though DOM is designed to be used with any programming language, JavaScript was used.
There are 15 JavaScript Methods for DOM manipulations, of the 15 methods I used EventListener:
•	querySelector(), querySelectorAll(), addEventListener(), removeEventListener(), createElement(), appendChild, removeChild(), replaceChild(), cloneNode(), insertBefore(),
•	createDocumentFragment(),  getComputedStyle(), setAttribute(), getAttribute(), removeAttribute().

JavaScript code was written to dynamically extract data from a UFO Sighting database and place it into a table format. Users can search the data using table column names. The results are displayed as a HTML document that used EventListener. The EventListener is activated every time a search is made on a specific column; thereby finding rows that matched the user’s input.
Lastly, multiple input tags were created to filter and search through the UFO sightings table data for five of the seven table columns.
